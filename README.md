Synesthesia
===========
This project is a multimedia MIDI visualization program that allows user customization with a growing library of visuals. It is conceptually based on the Music Animation Machine project: http://www.musanim.com/

The end result of using this program looks like this:

Requirements:

-pyglet 1.2alpha (with AVBin for mp3 playback)

-ConfigObj

Using the program:

Install the Pyglet and ConfigObj libraries (as well as AVBin for MP3 playback; see Pyglet website for details). Start the program by executing main.py. Type Ctrl+N to create a new config file based off an existing MIDI file and an existing MP3. The config file can be edited using a standard text editor. The config file allows user customization of the MIDI visualization. After customizing, type Ctrl+L to load the file for playback. Once loaded, press Space to start and stop playback, Backspace to restart the playback from the beginning, and Escape to return to the previous screen.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvements, please let me know at mattlouvier@gmail.com

As this is my first "published" project, any help for improving things is greatly appreciated!
